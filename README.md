# TripChat: A Long-Term Planning Agent Hierarchy for Travel

![Agent Hierarchy Image](./public/chat_hierarchy.png)

## Overview

TripChat revolutionizes the process of travel planning by implementing a hierarchical agent structure. In this system, agents with specialized roles collaborate to curate a comprehensive and personalized trip plan. Each agent focuses on different aspects of travel, such as discovering local events, booking hotels, finding the best flight options, and more. This organized division of labor enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of the trip planning process.
### Key Features

- **Hierarchical Agent Structure**: Different teams and agents work together for a unified goal, enhancing the efficiency of travel planning.
- **Microsoftâ€™s Autogen Framework**: Utilizes the Autogen framework for multi-agent systems and GroupChat for agent communication.
- **Langchain Framework**: Low-level agent implementation for direct interaction with external tools and APIs.
- **Shared JSON Object**: A collaborative approach where each agent updates a shared object, akin to a collective Google Doc.
- **Diverse Agent Types**: Includes proxy, assistant, and GptAssistants, each with specific roles and capabilities.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**: Start by installing necessary dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
2. **Configure API Keys**: Modify the `keys.json` file with the relevant API keys. We use [this](https://rapidapi.com/DataCrawler/api/booking-com15) Booking.com API.
3. **Running the Application**: Navigate to the `src/` folder and run `python3 main.py`.

## Usage

After running `main.py`, provide a query detailing your trip plan requirements (dates, destinations, etc.). The system will guide you through the process.

## Agent System

- **GroupChat Dynamics**: Agents communicate in rounds, with a manager coordinating the discussion.
- **Role-Based Communication**: Agents are aware of their team members' capabilities and communication is structured accordingly.
- **Speaker Selection Logic**: A novel approach to select speakers, enhancing the hierarchy and communication flow.
- **Functionality**: Agents use specific functions for updating the shared plan and interacting with external tools.
